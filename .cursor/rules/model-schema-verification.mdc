# Model Schema Verification

## Critical Rule

**Never assume model field names, types, or relationships.** Always verify the actual model definition before writing ORM code.

## Verification Command

```bash
uv run python manage.py model_schema "ModelName"
```

This command outputs the complete model definition including:
- All field names and types
- Foreign key relationships
- Many-to-many relationships
- Custom methods and properties
- Related name configurations

## Example Usage

```bash
# Check Student model fields
uv run python manage.py model_schema "Student"

# Check CustomTopic relationships
uv run python manage.py model_schema "CustomTopic"
```

Always verify the model schema
