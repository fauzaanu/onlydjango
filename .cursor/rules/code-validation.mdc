# Code Validation

After making code changes, run these validation commands to ensure quality:

```bash
# Type checking
uv run pyright

# Linting and auto-fix
uv run ruff check --fix

# Django system checks
uv run python manage.py check

# Template validation
uv run python manage.py validate_templates

# Test suite - Always use noinput
uv run python manage.py test --noinput
```

## Before Committing UI Changes

**Always run the Tailwind CSS build before commits:**

```bash
npm run build:css
git status  # Check if style.css was modified
```

NOTE: ONLY RUN GIT OPS IF THE USER ASKS YOU TO

If `onlydjango/static/css/style.css` shows as modified, include it in your commit.

Run these checks selectively based on the scope of your changes. Not every change requires all checks.
