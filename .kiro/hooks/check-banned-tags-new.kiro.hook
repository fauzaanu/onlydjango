HTML comments `<!-- -->` — should use Django comments `{# #}` instead\n\nIf ANY of these are found, append entries to `todo.md` (create it if it doesn't exist). Format each entry like:\n\n```\n## [filename] - Banned Template Patterns\n- Line [N]: `{% with %}` found — replace with Cotton `:variable` syntax\n- Line [N]: `<!-- comment text -->` found — replace with Django comment `{# #}`\n```\n\nInclude the exact line numbers and the offending code snippet for each violation. Do NOT fix the issues — only document them in todo.md. If no banned patterns are found, do nothing."
