# Dont ever create migrations

migrations must be generated by running `uv run python manage.py makemigrations` rather than manually writing them. 
99% of the time this will be an automatic process and will be fine.

In some case where you need to manually edit a migration you may do so.
You will never even think of deleting all migrations and starting over unless the user explicitly says so. 

(starting over would not be possible for apps already in production, however if it is really only in development we could do that, but you should always ask the user to do this)

> TLDR: Dont ever create migrations, generate them using django commands
