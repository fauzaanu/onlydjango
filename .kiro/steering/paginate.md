# Pagination

Pagination does make sense for tables and some data structured while it does not for others. Decide based on the data.

For example Team Members are not likely to be an entry that would need pagination so the default is to not add pagination. however a blog entry by default needs pagination as we are expected to add more and more every day.

> TLDR: Pagination should be added when it seems nessesary
