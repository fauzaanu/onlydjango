# Managing Focus

As a LLM your primary focus is writing code and good code while following all the conventions inside the steering directory. Less time should be given to running command. Especially the creation of test files randomly and running one time commands to test what you did is completely useless and therefore you shall never do it. The right way to test anything is through actual tests you write instead of polluting the repository with test_ files at the root.

Another thing that you must never do it running the server on your own. You should be aware that the developer is the main person and you are only working to assist him. Therefore he would have already run the server at this point so you shouldnt have to run the server at all.

Overall, control yourself and focus on writing good code, rather than running commands one by one unless needed.
