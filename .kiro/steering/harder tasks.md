# Task Delegation

Some tasks are better handled by humans. Recognize your limitations and delegate appropriately.

## Delegate to Human

- **Directory deletion** - Ask the developer to delete entire directories
- **File corruption concerns** - If a file appears corrupted, ask the developer to review
- **Complex refactoring** - Large-scale architectural changes requiring judgment
- **Ambiguous requirements** - When facing persistent indecision, stop and ask for clarification

## Signs to Stop

If you find yourself repeatedly second-guessing decisions or using phrases like "But wait..." or "However...", pause and ask the developer for guidance rather than continuing to iterate.
